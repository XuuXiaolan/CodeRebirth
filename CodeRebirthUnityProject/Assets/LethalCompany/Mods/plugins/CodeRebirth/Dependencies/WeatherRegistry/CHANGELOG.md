# 0.2.0

## Please re-generate your configs!

- merged [#7: refactor: modify many LogWarnings -> LogDebugs](https://github.com/AndreyMrovol/LethalWeatherRegistry/pull/7) (thanks, `mamallama`!)
- fixed `WeatherController` not syncing weather changes correctly (thanks, `giosuel`!)
- fixed an issue with [LobbyControl](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mattymatty/LobbyControl/)'s `lobby clear` command spawning weather **`6`**
- changed how weather->weather weights are defined to be more intuitive:
  - previously setting `None@200` in Rainy meant that if None was the previous weather, Rainy is set to 200 weight
  - now setting `None@200` in Rainy means that if Rainy was the previous weather, None is set to 200 weight
  - updated the config entry description to reflect the change
- added a toggle for using Registry's scrap multipliers
- added a toggle between Registry's _weighted_ weather selection and a vanilla algorithm
- added `WeatherSelectionAlgorithm` class for allowing custom weather selection algorithms in the future
- added `CurrentWeathers` class for easier management of selected weathers **(this is a breaking change for `WeatherManager.CurrentWeathers`!)**
- added methods allowing to modify randomWeathers to `WeatherController`: `SetRandomWeathers`, `AddRandomWeather`, `RemoveRandomWeather`
- added `Enabled` property to `ConfigHandler`: weather developers can now opt-out of the Registry config entries from being used (thanks, `xuxiaolan`!)
- added `WeatherEffectOverride` class for defining weather effect overrides
