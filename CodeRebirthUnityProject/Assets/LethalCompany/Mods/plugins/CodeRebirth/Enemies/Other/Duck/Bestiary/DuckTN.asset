    Name: The Duck\n\nTell me the duck story\r\nBum bum bum, ba-dum ba-dum\r\n\r\nA
    duck walked up to a lemonade stand\r\nAnd he said to the man, running the stand\r\n\"Don't
    you get tired of this same charade?\"\r\n\r\nThe man said \"No, we just sell
    lemonade\r\nBut it\u2019s cold and it's fresh, and it\u2019s all home-made.\r\nCan
    I get you a glass?\"\r\nThe duck said \u201CDon't you want more than this endless
    cycle?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he waddled away, waddle waddle\r\n'Til the very next
    day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum\r\n\r\nWhen the duck walked up to the lemonade
    stand\r\nAnd he said to the man, running the stand\r\n\"I tire of you, plaything,
    your anger is no longer satisfying.\"\r\n\r\nThe man said \"No, like I said yesterday\r\nWe
    just sell lemonade. Okay?\r\nWhy not give it a try?\"\r\nThe duck said \"This
    world bores me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he waddled away, waddle waddle\r\nThen he waddled
    away, waddle waddle\r\nThen he waddled away, waddle waddle\r\n'Til the very next
    day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum\r\n\r\nWhen the duck walked up to the lemonade
    stand\r\nAnd he said to the man running the stand\r\n\"It is time for me to find
    more entertainment elsewhere\"\r\n\r\nThe man said \"Look, this is getting old\r\nI
    mean, lemonade\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever sold\r\nWhy not give it a go?\"\r\nThe
    duck said \u201CFarewell lemonade man\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he waddled away, waddle
    waddle\r\nThen he waddled away, waddle waddle waddle\r\nThen he waddled away,
    waddle waddle\r\nbum bum bum bum bum ba-dum\r\n\r\nThe duck bored of the lemonade
    man's anger,\r\nVentured through the cosmos.\r\nHe waddled and waddled, searching.\r\nUntil
    he stumbled upon some unfortunate souls.\r\n\r\nThe men of scrap, orange in garments,
    their screams of terror,\r\nauthentic and invigorating.\r\nThe duck had found
    his new entertainment..."
