> Designation : Bug Zapper  
> Objective : Pest Control  
>
> These giant electric zappers, capable of delivering fatal electric shocks, were instrumental in the protection of valuable assets. After detecting a threat, the giant tesla coil would charge up before delivering a strong shock, deterring or killing any attackers.  
> [Final Recorded Equipment Transmission]  
> [ERROR] Software critical failure - Objective updated : Zap metal carrier, Zap bug, Zap, Zap, Zap.

### Laser Turret

![LT](https://i.postimg.cc/1t3v2Q4N/image.png)

> Designation : Laser Assisted Soil Excavation Rig (L.A.S.E.R.)  
> Objective : Mine and Extract minerals
>
> The L.A.S.E.R. is the back bone of mining operations, this experimental tech uses a massive carved ruby that focuses light into a single point creating a laser capable of melting solid rock. Energy efficient and powerful, this device is instrumental in the quick extraction of ores.  
> [Final Recorded Equipment Transmission]  
> [ERROR] Software critical failure - Objective updated : Spin, Mine, Spin, Mine,Spin, Mine.

### Industrial Fan

![IF](https://i.postimg.cc/htGbKrcH/image.png)

> Designation : Industrial Fan
