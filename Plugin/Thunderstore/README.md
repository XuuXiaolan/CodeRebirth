## Hazard Config Explanation
<details>
  <summary><strong>Hazard Config and tool</strong></summary>

- Small tidbit on how the hazard config works for the inside hazards such as LaserTurret, FlashTurret, TeslaShock, etc.
- Config follows this structure: `MoonName - X1,Y1 ; X2,Y2 ; X3,Y3 | MoonName2 - Etc....`.
- The separators are:
  - `-` for MoonName and Coordinates
  - `,` for x and y value of a coordinate.
  - `;` for separating coordinates.
  - `|` for separating entries.
- This follows how vanilla spawns hazards on moons accurately, where vanilla generates a number between 0 and 1 and assigns it to the `X-axis`.
- Using that X-axis value, it picks the corresponding Y-value, rounds it to an integer and spawns that amount of hazards.
- It's done as a curve so that, depending on luck, you can have days where you spawn almost no hazards and on some days you have `Microwave Hell`, similar to some moons' `Turret Hell` rare occurance.
- Tool for visualising and creating curves easily <https://cosmobrain0.github.io/graph-generation/>.
