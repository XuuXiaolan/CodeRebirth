  displayText: "Scrap-E Company Cleaning Unit\n\nI hate these things so damn much!!!
    I don't know what corporate was smoking when they started making these but goddamn
    it.\n\nNot only do these things steal all our stuff but they also go ballistic
    once a single of scrap touches the floor. And don't get me started on their annoying
    voices... not only will they throw you out like actual trash, they'll make you
    feel like it. We only managed to kill one of these cleaning units after getting
    thrown at a wall many times. On the bright side we got our items back, but I
    think we all came out of that facility as different people.\n\nI swear these
    things are sentient, they are everywhere and seem to know exactly what they're
    doing. Goddamn little shits. If we had the firepower, i'd put them all out of
    commission. \n\nLet it be known that the humble employee shall not be replaced
    by such vile machines!"
