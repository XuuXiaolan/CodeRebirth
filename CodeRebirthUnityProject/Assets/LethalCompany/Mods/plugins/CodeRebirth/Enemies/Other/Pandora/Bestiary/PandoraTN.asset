  displayText: 'Transporting unit Jimothy



    The transporter unit, also called
    Jimothy or Jim for short by the whole crew, is a small spherical robot controlling
    a forklift vehicle. These units we''re used along side many other pieces of equipment
    during secretive mining operations. However once the machinery went haywire and
    killed all the mining crews, the remaining Jim''s we''re left to rot and slowly
    degrade into their current state. They still go around carrying the equipment
    and crates that once served the crews not knowing about its precarious situation.



    Usually
    one of these robots would be incinerated after a year of use. Company found it
    more profitable to make new ones from cheaper parts then higher tech robots.
    Despite all odds this unit remains operational. Analysis of his signal outputs
    shows that everything it does is rewarded by its learning program. In short,
    it thinks it''s doing a good job.'
