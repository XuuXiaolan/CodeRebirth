  displayText: "Sigurd's Danger Level: Unknown\r\n\r\nScientific Name: Dominus automata\r\n\r\nThe
    Puppeteer is a towering, well-dressed figure cloaked in mystery, frequently observed
    within the halls of the mansion. Knives protrude from its back like bristling
    spines, and a wooden puppet dangles from its grasp. Its movements are silent
    and precise. While little is known about its origins, fragmented records suggest
    the creature may be tied to an enigmatic history of betrayal, bloodshed, and
    occult practices.\r\n\r\nFragments of the creature imply that creature is made
    of living wood, porous and still breathing. A combination of esoteric voodoo
    rituals and a bloodstained cloak, is believed to be integral to its existence.
    The cloak itself is said to bear an unsettling aura, exuding a quiet malice as
    though harbouring the essence of something\u2014or someone\u2014long departed.
    Those who have trespassed within the mansion report inexplicable feelings of
    dread, followed by abrupt disappearances among their party. Their bodies later
    found dead next to limp wooden puppets. Analysis of the wounds reveals that they
    were afflicted by no external physical force.\r\n\r\nThe creature's behaviour
    is predatory yet ritualistic. Its demeanour and protection of its valuables seems
    to show a capability of attachment and emotions. Scattered religious objects
    and obscure markings found throughout the manor also reinforce signs of human
    level intellect and possibly sapience. The discovery of human and animal bodies
    covered in symbols also suggest a fascination with ensnaring and experimenting
    on those it deems intruders. Whether this is of its own volition or its creator\u2019s
    intent remains unclear.\r\n\r\nIf confronted, attempt to flee. Combat is highly
    discouraged. Afterall, the Lord of the manor doesn't like uninvited guests."
