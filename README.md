### Weathers

#### Ion Storm

#### Orbital Drops

- **Availability:** Worlds like Artifice, Embrion, and those with Old-Bird presence
- **Effects:** Randomly, every 30 minutes to 6 hours, an Old Bird drops from orbit, activated upon arrival. There is a chance an existing Old Bird is awakened instead of a new one dropping.

#### Orbital Bombardment

- **Availability:** Same as Orbital Drops
- **Effects:** Sirens warn of incoming orbital barrages that last up to a minute, causing significant damage to anything outdoors. Occasionally, inactive bombs can be collected as valuable scrap.

- **Effects:** Certain areas are enveloped in a glowing purple mist that pacifies creatures and grants a temporary boost to players, similar to a TZP effect.

- **Effects:** Causes heat ripples, faster stamina drain, and increased movement penalty due to heat. Reduces enemy spawn rates outdoors.

#### Fire Tornadoes

- **Availability:** Desert and Hot Moons
